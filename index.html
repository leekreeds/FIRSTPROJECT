 contribute "nothing but delays.”.</p>

<h1 id="tma">JONATHAN SIMS</h1>
<h3 id="whattheghost">encounters with the fears</h3>
<p id="mkb">Web - John's childhood encounter with A Guest for Mr. Spider. He would've been eaten if not for his childhood bully taking the 
 Leitner away and getting enthralled in John's place.</p>

<p id="mkb">Corruption - Jane Prentiss's attack on the Archives, which left John with pockmark scars where the worms burrowed into his skin.</p>

<p id="mkb">Spiral - Helen Richardson's statement drew the Distortion's attention to John. He has gone through the doors several times and been stabbed once by 
 Michael. He has had multiple encounters with both Michael and Helen. Elias commented that John is deeply marked by the Spiral.</p>

<p id="mkb">Stranger - Not-Sasha's infiltration of the institute and John's close encounter with her, as well as The Unknowing.</p>

<p id="mkb">Desolation - Jude Perry, an avatar of the Desolation, gave John her statement and shook his hand, burning him.</p>

<p id="mkb">Vast - Mike Crew, an avatar of the Vast, gave John his statement and let him experience the sensation of the Vast firsthand.</p>

<p id="mkb">Hunt - Daisy's attempted murder of him, interrupted by Basira Hussain. Planned by Elias in that he "[left] the matter of Jonathan Sims up to [her]", 
 and requested she kill him quickly.</p>

<p id="mkb">Slaughter - Melanie King, infected with a bullet that fuelled her with rage, stabbed John when he attempted surgery to remove it. Elias hired Melanie as a 
 way of keeping her in the Archives until she could mark John.</p>

<p id="mkb">End - John's attempt to stop the Unknowing left him in a coma where he was "all but brain dead,"during which he was approached by Oliver Banks, an avatar 
 of the End, and then died before fully becoming the Beholding's avatar.</p>

<p id="mkb">Flesh - John had two ribs removed by Jared Hopworth, an avatar of the Flesh.</p>

<p id="mkb">Buried - John's descent into the coffin to rescue Daisy. Elias purposely sent Basira away to give John a chance to go in.</p>

<p id="mkb">Dark - In Ny-Ålesund John looked upon the Dark Sun, a star left behind from the Dark's failed ritual, and destroyed it. It was said that only powerful 
 followers of the Dark could safely look at it.</p>

<p id="mkb">Lonely - Peter Lukas, an avatar of The Lonely, had taken Martin into a pocket dimension of the Lonely. John went in after them and killed Peter in the 
 process.</p>
